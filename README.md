# Welcome to Niels' engineering challenge!

The project has two applications that are required to be running in order to use it. To start, please run the following

```shell
npm run install
```

Once that's done, you can run the following command to start it all up
```shell
npm run deploy
```

This will start everything up, and once it is started, you should be able to access the project in your browser using http://localhost:8080
